# 🛒 Go-Commerce-Microservices

Go-Commerce-Microservices is a robust and scalable e-commerce platform built with a microservices architecture using Go (Golang) 🐹.

This project leverages modern Go libraries and tools to deliver:

* ⚡ High-performance

* 🔧 Maintainable

* 📦 Independently deployable services

Designed with clean service boundaries and efficient inter-service communication, this platform aims to be a reliable foundation for real-world, production-grade e-commerce applications.




## ✨ Features

This project aims to provide a comprehensive **e-commerce solution**, broken down into distinct **microservices**. Key features include:

* **👥 User Management**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.

* **🛍️Product Catalog**: Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.

* **🛒Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, update, and remove items from their cart.

* **📦Order Processing**: Manages the lifecycle of orders, from creation to fulfillment.

* **💳Payment Integration**: (Planned) Connects with external payment gateways for secure transactions.

* **🔗Service-to-Service Communication**: Efficient communication between microservices using **REST APIs**.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project utilizes a powerful stack of **Go libraries and tools** to ensure efficiency and reliability:

**🐹Go (Golang)** : The primary programming language for all microservices.

**⚙️Gin Gonic** : A high-performance HTTP web framework for building RESTful APIs.

**🐘pgx** : A pure Go driver for PostgreSQL, offering excellent performance and features.

**📝sqlc** : Generates type-safe Go code from SQL queries, enhancing developer productivity and reducing errors.

**🗄️PostgreSQL** : A powerful, open-source relational database used for data persistence across services.

**⚙️Viper** : (Optional, but recommended) For flexible configuration management in Go applications.

**📑Zap** : (Optional, but recommended) A fast, structured, leveled logging library for Go.

**🔗Postman** : For API testing and debugging.

**📂Git / GitHub** : For version control and collaboration.

# go-commerce-microservices
This project aims to demonstrate how to develop scalable, resilient, and independently deployable services for an online retail application. Each core e-commerce function (e.g., product catalog, user management, order processing, payment gateway) is designed as a separate, lightweight microservice, communicating via APIs.
